TV3:
	Facebook: 50341 likes

	Youtube: 1342 subscribers
		Around 500-3000 views per video. Only clips and not full programs are uploaded.Individual channels such as Talang Sverige and Top Model Sverige have more than 3 and 10 times the followers as TV3 Sverige respectively. A way to consolidate the channels is to instead create playlists out of them, that also are 'followable' by users.

	Instagram: 
		4531 followers. Follows 434. 528 posts.
		Around 100 likes per post. The most liked post is a TV3 balloon from the pride festival with twice as many likes as the others. Once again - keep it personal and speak to the users. Sell them your culture and values, without selling them your content. That's a strong way of building a brand through social media.
	Twitter:
		3090 followers. Follows 638. 3862 Tweets. Joined December 2009.
		As a Twitter person they write short and interesting Tweets mainly about their own content. Their most popular Tweet is when they pick up on other users using their tags. Lesson learned: engage in the community and get interested in others in order for them to get interested in you. You're no longer only in the business of pushing content, but also pulling it in.

Kanal 5:
	Facebook: 117066 likes
	
	Youtube: 82612 subscribers
		Around 500-10000 views per video. Partaj has its own YouTube channel. Only clips and not full programs are uploaded. Content creation/upload activity is on a weekly basis. The other SBS Discovery channels are not fronted on YouTube.
	
	Instagram:
		2513 followers. Follows 27. 229 posts.
		Around 60 likes per post. The most liked post is of Filip and Jennie Hammar becoming parents. Personal and non-marketing. Yet it has twice as many likes as their other posts.

	Twitter:
		4750 followers. Follows 71 accounts. 1979 Tweets in total. Joined March 2009.
		As a Twitter person they are rarely re-tweeting. Unoriginal and unengaging. Is mainly interested in keeping a monologue.

SVT:
	Facebook: 60247 likes

	Youtube: 6993 subscribers
		Views per video varies wildly. They have no channels, but some playlists - with SVT Sport being the most popular one. Most of their popular clips are bloopers. Yet again; the content creation strategy should be built around the culture of each social media channel. Focus on the short and funny clips that you have in your vast library - they will be the drivers of views, subscribers and your identity.

	Instagram: 
		6111 followers. Follows 156. 614 posts.
		Around 130 likes per post. SVTSport is a separate account with over 14000 followers.
		Why the popularity? Well for one SVTSport actually serves news - value - as opposed to the SVT account which only feels like marketing. 

	Twitter:
		18700 followers. Follows 6777. 3025 Tweets. Joined February 2012.
		As a Twitter person they are mildly interesting and primarily Tweet about themselves.
		SVTSport on the other hand has 60K followers and 22K Tweets. The trend with SVT is that they might've realized that SVT Sport is such a big brand that merging it with SVT will dilute it on Twitter. SVT Nyheter also has 44K followers with 21.6K Tweets. We need to realize that social media is relevant when you use it as a news feed and not a marketing tool.

TV4:
	Facebook: 197817 likes

	Youtube: 5785 subscribers
		Views per video varies wildly. There's a lot of channels, more than warranted. The most popular one is Idol Sverige with 10K subscribers. On the upside there's a lot of content to consume as a viewer - but why not dig into the TV4 archives to drive traffic?

	Instagram: 
		25K followers. Follows 187. 842 posts.
		Around 1400 likes per post. Posts are interesting and worth following. A lesson learned is to have the different TV4 personalities have their own Instagram accounts and directly link to their accounts. You need to cross-breed between TV4 as a company, and your primary profiles.

	Twitter:
		12.4K followers. Follows 454. 11.5K Tweets. Joined April 2011.
		TV4 as a person on Twitter is fairly likeable and has a propensity for humour. TV4 Idol on the other hand is the most interesting account, witty, full of pictures and engaging. @TV4 should take notes. @fotbollskanalen links directly to fotbollskanalen.se while SVT Sport links to svt.se - a potential future consolidation of brands for TV4 might make this a good move.
